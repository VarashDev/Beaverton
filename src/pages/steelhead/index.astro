<h2>
    Introduction to Steelhead Fishing in Oregon
</h2>
<p>
    Steelhead, the migratory form of rainbow trout, are among the most sought-after sport fish in the Pacific Northwest. Known for their acrobatic jumps and relentless fights, they offer a thrilling challenge to anglers of all skill levels. Luckily, <strong>Beaverton, Oregon</strong> is ideally situated within an hour’s drive of several world-class steelhead rivers.
</p>
<h3>
    What Makes Steelhead Special?
</h3>
<p>
    Unlike salmon, steelhead can survive spawning and return to the ocean to spawn again. This unique lifecycle—along with their beauty and fighting spirit—makes them a prized catch among fly fishers and spin anglers alike.
</p>
<h3>
    Beaverton’s Strategic Location
</h3>
<p>
    Though Beaverton doesn't lie directly on a steelhead river, it’s surrounded by top-producing rivers such as the Clackamas, Sandy, and Wilson. These waters are perfect for quick day trips, with many offering public access and seasonal steelhead runs.
</p>
<h2>
    Understanding Steelhead Migration Patterns
</h2>
<p>
    Steelhead are anadromous, meaning they live in the ocean but migrate into freshwater streams to spawn.
</p>
<h3>
    Summer vs. Winter Steelhead
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Summer Steelhead:</strong> Enter rivers from May to October; found in smaller, clearer streams.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Winter Steelhead:</strong> Arrive between November and March; larger and more aggressive due to colder, higher flows.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    How Weather Affects Timing and Location
</h3>
<p>
    Water temperature and rainfall significantly affect when and where steelhead move:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Light rain in fall or winter can trigger strong steelhead migrations.
    </li>
    <li>
        In summer, cooler water temperatures early in the morning offer the best action.
    </li>
</ul>

        <strong>Dusk (4 PM – sunset)</strong>
