<h2>
    Introduction to Salmon Fishing in the Pacific Northwest
</h2>
<p>
    The Pacific Northwest is a salmon angler’s paradise, and <strong>Beaverton, Oregon</strong>, is nestled in one of its prime zones. Just a short drive from major rivers teeming with salmon, Beaverton offers an accessible base for beginners and seasoned fishers alike.
</p>
<h3>
    Why Oregon is a Prime Destination
</h3>
<p>
    Oregon's vast network of rivers and streams is known for its robust salmon runs. The mix of pristine natural habitats, conservation efforts, and state-managed fisheries ensures salmon thrive throughout the region.
</p>
<h3>
    Beaverton’s Close Access to Major Rivers
</h3>
<p>
    While Beaverton itself doesn’t sit directly on a salmon river, it’s within 30-60 minutes of several top fishing spots including the Willamette, Columbia, and Clackamas Rivers. This close proximity means you can plan day trips without the need for overnight camping—unless, of course, you want to.
</p>
<h2>
    Types of Salmon Found Near Beaverton
</h2>
<h3>
    Chinook (King) Salmon
</h3>
<p>
    Known for their size and strength, Chinook are prized catches. They run in both spring and fall, with some of the best action found in the Willamette and Columbia Rivers.
</p>
<h3>
    Coho (Silver) Salmon
</h3>
<p>
    Slightly smaller but just as aggressive, Coho salmon run in the fall and are often caught in tributaries and sloughs, offering exciting opportunities closer to shorelines.
</p>
<h3>
    Sockeye and Other Seasonal Species
</h3>
<p>
    Though less common than Chinook and Coho, Sockeye and other varieties like Pink or Chum may show up during certain years depending on the run.
</p>

<h3>
    Seasonal Runs and Migration Patterns
